Quickstart
------------

To be able to use Datatruck's OpenAPI you should create tokens from your dashboard. Go to your dashboard and create token 
with appropriate scopes and expiration. Expiration and scopes are optional as well as description for your token, 

but remember name is required.

Once you create your token, token is displayed only once so make sure you copy it 


to somewhere else. You can always regenerate the token or delete. Once you regenerate, previous token will stop working.
